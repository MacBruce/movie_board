## Movie Search App
This is a little pet project that I am using to get familiar with NodeJs, Express and EJS.
## The Plan
The plan of my application is to pull data from OMDB movie api, add login for users to sign in and comment their reviews and thoughts about what they think about the movie in a semi-anonymous platform.
## What has been done so far?
Express rendering the search.ejs file at the root level of the program, the search forms data is being saved to a variable which whill then be added to a request to the OMDB movie api, which will than render the items into my EJS template.
